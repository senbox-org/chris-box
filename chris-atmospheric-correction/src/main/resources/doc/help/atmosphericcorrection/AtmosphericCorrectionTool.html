  <h3>CHRIS/Proba Atmospheric Correction</h3>

  <h5>Introduction</h5>

  <p>The atmospheric correction, i.e. the conversion from
  top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance to reflectance images, is
  normally necessary for the reliable exploitation of remote
  sensing information. The CHRIS Atmospheric Correction Tool
  converts from TOA radiance to surface reflectance images in an
  automated manner. The different steps to be performed along the
  atmospheric correction process depend on the CHRIS acquisition
  mode. The columnar water vapor (CWV) is only derived for CHRIS
  acquisition modes 1, 3 and 5, as no sufficient sampling of water
  vapor absorption features is provided by modes 2 and 4. On the
  other hand, spectral calibration and an optional spectral
  polishing are only performed on modes 1 and 5, which are the ones
  resolving most of the atmospheric absorption bands in the
  400-1000 nm spectral range. The algorithm is implemented so that
  it must be applied after noise removal and cloud screening. The
  interface between atmospheric and geometric correction modules is
  not established at this stage of this project, so elevation and
  topographic effects calculated from a geolocated digital
  elevation model are not considered in current version of the
  Atmospheric Correction Tool.</p>

  <p>Note that the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness is part
  of the processing.</p>

  <p><em>Note that only a top threshold of AOT at 550nm is
  calculated by the current version of the aerosol retrieval module
  for CHRIS modes 1, 3, 4 and 5. The calculated top AOT value is
  labeled as 'Maximum AOT550' in the MPH file. An improved version
  of the aerosol retrieval algorithm over land may be implemented
  in the future, so that a more accurate AOT value is
  calculated.</em></p>

  <h3>Algorithm</h3>

  <h5>Overview</h5>

  <p>The algorithm implemented by the Atmospheric Correction Tool
  is described in detail by <a href=
  "%20http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1542362&amp;tag=1">
  Guanter et al. (2005)</a>. In brief, the following steps are
  carried out:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Smile correction for CHRIS acquisition modes 1 and 5.</li>

    <li>Calculation of surface reflectances by inverting the
    Lambertian equation. Simultaneous retrieval of columnar water
    vapour and surface reflectances for CHRIS acquisition modes 1
    and 5.</li>

    <li>Adjacency correction.</li>

    <li>Removal of systematic errors in surface reflectance
    (spectral polishing).</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Smile correction</h5>

  <h5>Calculation of surface reflectances</h5>

  <p>Please refer to <a href=

  et al. (2006)</a>.</p>

  <h5>Adjacency correction</h5>

  <p>Please refer to <a href=
  "http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-45-10-2360">Guanter
  et al. (2006)</a>.</p>

  <h5>Spectral polishing</h5>

  <p>Systematic errors are happening in surface reflectance with
  the same intensity and sign for all the targets. Out of
  absorption regions these errors are mostly due to problems in the
  instrument gain coefficients (radiometric calibration), but
  inside atmospheric absorptions they can also be associated to
  inaccurate radiative transfer simulations. The fact that they are
  systematic allows the correlation with an error-free reference
  reflectance for the correction. It is assumed that the errors are
  not caused by dark current effects, but result from problems in
  the gain coefficients only.</p>

  <p>The inversion of artificial endmembers is utilised to provide
  the reference reflectance. Smooth spectra are calculated by the
  unmixing endmember abundances in spiky spectra. Up to 50
  reference spectra are extracted from the reflectance images
  derived from the Lambertian equation. The selection is made from
  a previous classification of the area based on three Normalized
  Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) categories: vegetation, bare
  soil and mixtures. A recalibration coefficient for each CHRIS
  channel is calculated by correlating the 50 pairs of spectral
  reflectance from the spiky and smooth spectra. The reflectance
  image is multiplied by these recalibration coefficients, yielding
  the final reflectancess.</p>

  <p>It must be remarked that the spectral polishing can lead to
  errors in reflectance for images where the endmembers can not
  reproduce the actual reflectance levels. For this reason, the
  recalibration process is carried out under user request only.</p>

  <h3>User Interface</h3>

  <p>The atmospheric correction tool can be invoked from VISAT tool
  menu by selecting the <b>Atmospheric Correction...</b> command in
  the <b>CHRIS-Box</b> submenu. In the command line it is available
  by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code> which is
  located in the BEAM <code>bin</code> directory. For further
  information type <code>gpt chris.ComputeSurfaceReflectances
  -h</code> at the command prompt.</p>

  <p>Selecting the <b>Atmospheric Correction...</b> command from
  the VISAT tool menu pops up the following dialog:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/ac-dialog.png" alt=
  "Atmospheric Correction Dialog" /></p>

  <h5>Source Product Group</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Here the user specifies the name of
  the source product. The combo box presents a list of all products
  open in VISAT. The user may select one of these or, by clicking
  on the button next to the combo box, choose a product from the
  file system.</p>

  <h5>Target Product Group</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Used to specify the name of the target
  product.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Save as:</b> Used to specify whether the target
  product should be saved to the file system. The combo box
  presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF,
  and HDF5. The text field allows to specify a target
  directory.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Open in VISAT:</b> Used to specify whether the
  target product should be opened in VISAT. When the the target
  product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/ac-parameters.png" alt=
  "Atmospheric Correction Parameters" /></p>

  <h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Aerosol optical thickness:</b> Use this field to
  specify the value of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550
  nm. The default value is 0.0, which leads to an aerosol optical
  thickness being retrieved as part of the processing.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Initial water vapour column:</b> Use this field
  to specify the initial guess of the water vapour (WV) column (g
  cm-2) used for WV retrieval. The default value is 1.0.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Cloud product threshold:</b> Use this field to
  specify the threshold used for deciding whether a pixel is cloudy
  or not. Pixels with cloud product values exceeding the threshold
  are considered as cloudy. The default value is 0.05.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Perform adjacency correction:</b> Use this check
  box to specify whether the adjacency correction should be carried
  out or not. The adjacency correction is switched off by
  default.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Perform spectral polishing:</b> Use this check
  box to specify whether the spectral polishing for CHRIS mode 1
  and 5 acquisitions should be carried out or not. The spectral
  polishing works very nicely in most cases, but, in rare cases,
  can be very bad. Spectral polishing is switched off by default.
  This option has no effect for CHRIS acquisition modes 2, 3, and
  4.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Generate water vapour map:</b> Use this check
  box to specify whether a map of the columnar water vapour
  retrieved should be added to the target product. Switched off by
  default. This option has no effect for CHRIS acquisition modes 2
  and 4.</p>

  <h5>Button Group</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Run</b> Creates the target product. The
  atmospheric correction is actually deferred until the target band
  data are accessed, either by writing the product to the file
  system or by viewing the band data. When the <b>Save as</b>
  option is checked, the atmospheric correction is triggered
  automatically.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Close</b> Closes the dialog.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Help</b> Displays this page in VISAT Help.</p>
