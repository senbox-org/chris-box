  <h3>CHRIS/Proba Geometric Correction</h3>

  <h5>Introduction</h5>

  <p>CHRIS/Proba is a system designed for multi-angular image
  acquisition of a given target, with the capability of along-track
  and across-track pointing increasing its overpass frequency. In
  order to increase the radiometric signal the platform performs a
  slow-down manoeuvre consisting in rotating while scanning to keep
  the target for a longer time under the sensor. Besides, the scan
  direction is reversed during the acquisition of the second and
  fourth images to reduce the acceleration needed for the
  operation. These characteristics introduce strong perspective
  distortions, especially for the first and last images with larger
  observation zenith angles, which are difficult to remove by other
  approaches.</p>

  <p>Many applications require the images to be geometrically
  referenced and/or rectified. In particular for those that make
  use of multi-angular information the geometric processing must be
  very accurate.</p>

  <h5>Algorithm</h5>

  <p>The proposed approach for the geometric correction of
  CHRIS/Proba is based on the parametric modelling of the
  acquisition process. It makes use of the satellite's position,
  velocity and pointing at the moment of line acquisition,
  projecting the line of sight onto the Earth's surface to
  calculate the geographical coordinate of each pixel. The
  coordinate map can then be used for the ortho-rectification of
  the images.</p>

  <p>In principle the algorithm does not require any user input,
  since it is based on the geometry of acquisition. Unfortunately
  the Proba platform does have a pointing problem, which has not
  been identified yet. Therefore, at least a single ground control
  point (GCP) per image is required in order to compensate for the
  de-pointing, although the precision of the single-GCP correction
  is not good enough. Three GCPs per image provide satisfactory
  results, and nine well distributed GCPs per image result in an
  excellent co-registration of all 5 images, for the tested cases
  (all in Barrax).</p>

  <p>The choice of the orbital parametric approach is based on the
  particular requirements the acquisition process of CHRIS/Proba
  imposes on other existing methods for geometric correction.</p>

  <p>The GCP method requires a quite large number of points for an
  accurate geometric correction (at least 30, and more than 50 for
  high accuracy over flat terrain), and they need to be evenly
  distributed. These requirements exists for each image in the
  acquisition set</p>

  <p>An alternative method is based on the photogrammetric equation
  applied to the five images, but it makes the assumption that each
  image is acquired instantly from a fixed point in space, which is
  not the case for CHRIS/Proba. In order to compensate this
  difference in the acquisition assumptions the use of GCPs
  distributed through the image is necessary</p>

  <p>The overlap of the five images is not too high, around 65%
  (estimate) due to de-pointing, but even with perfect pointing,
  larger observation angles provide different spatial coverage due
  to perspective. Therefore the co-registration of the five images
  is only possible in a portion of each image, which reduces the
  accuracy in the excluded areas. This makes necessary a
  high-resolution reference image for the selection of GCPs.</p>

  <p>Even if the requirements of these methods were met, there is
  the unsolved problem of open water targets, where it is not
  possible to use GCP at all, except for very few pixels in the
  best case. The same situation appears in the case of cloudy
  images, rendering useless scenes that might have still some
  useful portions.</p>

  <p>The inputs needed by the algorithm are: telemetry with the
  satellite position, velocity and image timing, target centre
  coordinate, and, for doing an ortho-rectification, a local
  digital elevation model (DEM). The outputs of this algorithm
  consist on the coordinates map in IGM files, or the rectified
  images if so desired. As side product, observation angle maps can
  be produced for each image.</p>

  <p>It must be noted that the method requires the corresponding
  telemetry for each acquisition.</p>

  <p>An archive of updated telemetry data is accesible at <a href=
  "http://194.78.233.110/products/data/CHRIS_Additional_data/index.html">
  http://194.78.233.110/products/data/CHRIS_Additional_data/index.html</a>.
  Older packed telemetry data can be downloaded from <a href=
  "http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/data/Archive_CHRIS_Tags_12000_38000_Telemetry_Data.zip">
  http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/data/Archive_CHRIS_Tags_12000_38000_Telemetry_Data.zip</a>.
  The algorithm requires that archive is available unpacked on the
  local file system.</p>

  <p>In order to find the corresponding telemetry files for a given
  acquisition the user has to follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Get <b>[Target Name]</b> and <b>[Date]</b> from
    the image meta data; the dashes '-' from the date have to be
    ignored. For example, for image CHRIS_MB_080501_9BE1_41 the
    <b>[Target Name]</b> is <em>Manly-Beach</em> and the
    <b>[Date]</b> is <em>20080501</em>, where the dashes '-'
    have been removed in the meta data date value, which is
    <em>2008-05-01</em></li>

    <li>Connect to the <a href=
    "http://194.78.233.110/products/data/CHRIS_Additional_data/index.html">
    telemetry archive</a></li>

    <li>Use a filter <b>*.[Target
    Name]?????_CHRIS_center_times_[Date]_*</b> to locate the
    Image Center Times file. For the example above it finds the
    file
    <em>Pass9301.Manly-Beach_39905_CHRIS_center_times_20080501_65534</em></li>

    <li><b>?????</b> should match a five-digit string to be
    used as reference <b>[Ref]</b>. For the example above it
    is <em>39905</em></li>

    <li>Use a filter <b>CHRIS_[Ref]_*.tar.gz</b> to locate
    the compressed GPS file. For the example above it finds
    <em>CHRIS_39905_39909.tar.gz</em></li>

    <li>From the compressed GPS file extract the file
    <b>CHRIS_[Ref]_PROBA1_GPS_Data</b>, where PROBA's GPS
    position and velocity data are recorded. The second file in the
    compressed GPS file <b>PPU_UPLOAD_*</b> can be ignored.
    For the example above extract the file
    <em>CHRIS_39905_39909_PROBA1_GPS_Data</em></li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Getting started</h5>

  <p>First download and unpack the CHRIS telemetry data, which are
  a prerequisite for the geometric correction. Then carry out the
  geometric correction:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open a CHRIS/proba atmosphere-corrected product, or any
    derived product (the geometric correction is applicable to any
    CHRIS product, but the geometric correction marks the last step
    in the processing, i.e. the user can geo-correct a
    noise-corrected image, but then cannot process the
    geo-corrected image with the CHRIS-Box tools any further)</li>

    <li>Define at least three GCPs near to the first, central, and
    last rows in the image; additional GCPs yield better results.
    It is recommended to place nine GCP evenly distributed through
    the image
      <pre>
    +---+---+---+
    | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    +---+---+---+
    | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    +---+---+---+
</pre>Besides latitude and longitude, the user may specify a GCP's
altitude by adding something like <code>Madrid (alt[m] =
750)</code> to the description of a GCP. This is optional and not
required, but improves the calculation of the instrument's pointing
especially in areas with strong topography. If not provided, the
target's altitude is used.
    </li>

    <li>If the target has a flat topography the user may check the
    '<b>Use target altitude</b>' option in the processing
    parameters. If the target is not flat, results might still be
    fine when this option is checked</li>

    <li>Run the geometric correction tool</li>

    <li>Run the BEAM ortho-rectification tool on the geo-corrected
    product in order to obtain an ortho-rectified product; this
    must never be done when the '<b>Use target altitude</b>' option
    has been checked.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Instructions on how to use a DEM can be found in the VISAT
  Help by searching for DEM.</p>

  <h3>User Interface</h3>The geometric correction tool can be
  invoked from VISAT tool menu by selecting the <b>Geometric
  Correction...</b> command in the <b>CHRIS-Box</b> submenu. In the
  command line it is available by means of the Graph Processing
  Tool <code>gpt</code> which is located in the BEAM
  <code>bin</code> directory. For further information type
  <code>gpt chris.PerformGeometricCorrection -h</code> at the
  command prompt.

  <p>The geometric correction adds grids for latitude and
  longitude, as well as view azimuth and zenith angles to an
  existing CHRIS/Proba product.</p>

  <p>Selecting the <b>Geometric Correction...</b> command from the
  VISAT tool menu pops up the following dialog:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/gc-dialog.png" alt=
  "Geometric Correction Dialog" /></p>

  <p>The user will be asked to update the auxiliary time tables,
  which are included in the module. The required time tables are
  updated at <a href=
  "ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/">ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/</a>
  every week. The user must let the time tables be updated
  regularly, if he works with recent CHRIS/Proba products.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/gc-time-tables.png" alt=
  "Update Time Tables Dialog" /></p>

  <h5>Source Product Group</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Here the user specifies the name of
  the source product. The combo box presents a list of all products
  open in VISAT. The user may select one of these or, by clicking
  on the button next to the combo box, choose a product from the
  file system.</p>

  <h5>Target Product Group</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Used to specify the name of the target
  product.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Save as:</b> Used to specify whether the target
  product should be saved to the file system. The combo box
  presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF,
  and HDF5. The text field allows to specify a target
  directory.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Open in VISAT:</b> Used to specify whether the
  target product should be opened in VISAT. When the the target
  product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/gc-parameters.png" alt=

  <h5>Processing Parameters Panel</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Telemetry repository:</b> This field is used to
  specify the directory, which contains the CHRIS telemetry data.
  Note that the parent directory of the source product is searched
  for CHRIS telemetry data <em>before</em> the local repository
  is.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Use target altitude:</b> This field is used to
  specify that the nominal target altitude shall be taken into
  account when calculating the longitude and latitude coordinates,
  i.e. the pixel lines-of-sight are intersected with a modified
  WGS-84 ellipsoid, which is increased by the nominal target
  altitude. <em>Note that the resulting geo-coding is more accurate
  when option has been checked, but not suitable for
  ortho-rectification.</em>.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Include pitch and roll angles:</b> This field is
  used to specify that the instrument pitch and roll angles, which
  are calculated, shall be included in the product. This option is
  for diagnostics only.</p>

  <h5>Button Group</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Run</b> Creates the target product. The
  geometric correction is actually deferred until the target band
  data are accessed, either by writing the product to the file
  system or by viewing the band data. When the <b>Save as</b>
  option is checked, the atmospheric correction is triggered
  automatically.</p>
