  <h3>CHRIS/Proba Noise Reduction</h3>

  <p>The Noise Reduction Tool is used to correct and remove the
  coherent noises, known as <b>drop-outs</b> and <b>vertical
  striping</b>, usually found in hyperspectral images acquired by
  push-broom sensors such as CHRIS.</p>

  <h5>Introduction</h5>

  <p>Hyperspectral images acquired by remote sensing instruments
  are generally affected by two kinds of noise. The first one can
  be defined as standard random noise, which varies with time and
  determines the minimum image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In
  addition, hyperspectral images can present non-periodic partially
  deterministic disturbance patterns, which come from the image
  formation process and are characterized by a high degree of
  spatial and spectral coherence. The objective of the Noise
  Reduction Tool is to correct or reduce these noise signals before
  any further processing.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Drop-outs:</b> One of the errors affecting CHRIS images
    is the fact that transmission of CHRIS channel 2 (odd and even
    pixels from each CCD row are read in parallel) randomly fails
    producing anomalous values at the odd pixels in some image rows
    called drop-outs. Drop-outs hamper the operational use of CHRIS
    images since latter processing stages are drastically affected
    by these anomalous pixels. These errors must be identified and
    corrected by making use of both spatial and spectral
    information of the anomalous pixel and its neighbors.</li>

    <li><b>Vertical striping:</b> Another well-known problem of
    CHRIS images is a spatial coherent noise usually found in
    images acquired by push-broom sensors. This multiplicative
    noise in image columns comes from irregularities of the
    entrance slit of the spectrometer and CCD elements in the
    across-track direction (horizontal lines). Although the whole
    system was fully characterized after assembly, changes in
    temperature (due to the seasonal variation of the in-orbit
    CHRIS instrument temperature) produce a dilation of the slit
    that results in a complex vertical pattern dependent on the
    sensor's temperature, and thus it must be modeled and
    corrected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Noise Reduction Algorithm</h4>

  <p>The algorithm implemented by the Noise Reduction Tool is
  described in detail by <a href=
  "http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-47-28-F46">G&oacute;mez-Chova
  et al. (2008)</a>. In brief, the following steps are carried
  out:</p>

  <h5>Drop-out Correction</h5>

  <p>In CHRIS images, drop-outs can be seen as missing pixels with
  anomalous values (usually zero or negative values). These invalid
  values are detected and replaced by by a weighted average of the
  values of the neighboring pixels. In order to avoid the poor
  performance of spatial filters (local average) in border or
  inhomogeneous areas, the contribution of each pixel of a given
  neighborhood of size 3x3, is weighted by its similarity to the
  corrected pixel. In particular, this similarity weight is the
  inverse of the Euclidean distance between the spectral signature
  of the pixels, which is calculated locally using the spectral
  bands closer to the band presenting the drop-out. It is worth
  noting that the values of bands with errors are not considered
  during this process.</p>

  <p>The result of this process is similar to a spatial
  interpolation but taking into account the spectral similarity
  with neighbors. Although it is a cosmetic correction, it is
  needed since later processing stages are drastically affected by
  these anomalous pixel values.</p>

  <h5>Vertical Striping Correction</h5>

  <p>The objective of vertical striping correction methods is to
  estimate the correction factors of each spectral band to correct
  all the lines of this band. The main assumption consists in
  considering that both slit and CCD contributions change from one
  pixel to another (high spatial frequency) in the across-track
  direction but are constant in the along-track direction, i.e.
  during the image formation; while surface contribution presents
  smoother profiles (lower spatial frequencies) in the across-track
  dimension. Several algorithms already exist to reduce vertical
  striping, but most of them assume that the imaged surface does
  not contain structures with spatial frequencies of the same order
  than noise, which is not always the case. The proposed method
  introduces a way to exclude the contribution of the spatial high
  frequencies of the surface from the process of noise removal that
  is based on the information contained in the spectral domain.</p>

  <p>Standard vertical striping reduction approaches take advantage
  of the constant noise factors in the image columns. Basically,
  each image's column is averaged resulting in an averaged line
  (along-track) and then the noise profile is estimated in the
  across-track direction for each band. By averaging image lines
  (integrated line profile) the surface contribution is smoothed,
  the additive random noise is cancelled, and the vertical striping
  profile remains constant. Consequently, the surface contribution
  presents lower spatial frequencies in the integrated line profile
  and can be easily separated from the vertical striping (high
  frequencies) applying a filter with a suited cut-off
  frequency.</p>

  <p>One of the main drawbacks of these methods is the fact that
  they do not take into account the possible high frequency
  components of the surface explicitly. In images presenting
  structures or patterns in the vertical direction, the averaged
  profile may present high frequency contributions due to the
  surface. This will be interpreted as vertical striping, and some
  columns will be corrected with wrong values, worsening the final
  image. The proposed correction method is also based on the
  hypothesis that the vertical disturbance presents higher spatial
  frequencies than the surface radiance. However, it models the
  noise pattern by suppressing the surface contribution in the
  across-track in two different ways: first, avoiding the high
  frequency changes due to surface edges, and then subtracting the
  low frequency profile. In addition, thanks to the sequential
  acquisition of CHRIS of the same scene from five different
  angles, the robustness of the proposed algorithm can also be
  improved using together all the multiangular images of one
  acquisition. When processing together a higher number of lines,
  the surface contribution is smoother and the estimation of the
  vertical striping is more accurate.</p>

  <h5>Summary of the Complete Processing Chain</h5>

  <p>The optimal sequence of algorithms to be applied in order to
  correct a given image is the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Drop-outs are detected and corrected.</li>

    <li>A rough correction of the vertical striping due to the
    entrance slit is performed. For a given CHRIS image, the
    estimation of the slit vertical striping is obtained from a
    previous characterization of the vertical striping pattern
    stored in a look-up-table (LUT), which includes the dependence
    on the platform temperature at the given CHRIS acquisition</li>

    <li>After the preliminary correction of the vertical striping
    due to the entrance slit, the robust vertical striping
    correction method is used to estimate directly from the image
    (or multiangular image set) the remaining vertical striping for
    each band.</li>

    <li>Finally, obtained vertical striping coefficients are used
    to correct the image column values.</li>
