  <h3>CHRIS/Proba TOA Reflectance Computation</h3>

  <h4>TOA Reflectance Algorithm</h4>

  <p>CHRIS products are provided in top of the atmosphere (TOA)
  radiance (radiometrically calibrated data).<br />
  The TOA apparent reflectance is estimated according to:</p>

  <div align="center"><img src="images/ToaReflectanceFormula.jpg"
  alt="Toa Reflectance Formula" /></div>

  <p>where L(x, y, &lambda;<sub>i</sub>) is the provided at-sensor
  upward radiance at the image location (x, y),
  I(&lambda;<sub>i</sub>) is the extraterrestrial instantaneous
  solar irradiance, and &theta;(x, y) is the angle between the
  illumination direction and the vector perpendicular to the
  surface. In the proposed algorithm, &theta;(x, y) is approximated
  by the Solar Zenith Angle provided in the CHRIS attributes since
  one can assume flat landscape and constant illumination angle for
  the area observed in a CHRIS image. Finally, the Sun irradiance,
  I(&lambda;), is taken from Thuillier et al. (2003), corrected for
  the acquisition day, and convolved with the CHRIS spectral
  channels.</p>

  <p>The extraterrestrial solar irradiance I(&lambda;) given in
  Thuillier et al. (2003) is provided from 200 to 2400 nm in
  mW/m2/nm. It shall be corrected for the Julian day of year (DOY),
  J, according to the following approximate formulae:</p>

  <div align="center"><img src="images/ThuillierDoyCorrection.jpg"
  alt="Thuillier Julian day of year correction" /></div>

  <p>where the day of year can be easily obtained from the Image
  Date metadata of the CHRIS file.<br />
  Since the reference extraterrestrial solar irradiance presents a
  different spectral sampling, it is resampled to the CHRIS
  spectral channels. A specific CHRIS band, i, consists of the
  addition of one or more CCD detector pixel elements depending on
  the band width. Therefore, the spectral response of a CHRIS band,
  S<sub>i</sub>(&lambda;), is the sum of the the spectral response
  S(&lambda;) of the corresponding detectors of the CCD array.
  Then, the mean solar irradiance for a given band,
  I(&lambda;<sub>i</sub>), is obtained by integrating the
  extraterrestrial solar irradiance by its spectral response:</p>

  <div align="center"><img src=
  "images/MeanSolarIrradianceFormula.jpg" alt=
  "Mean Solar Irradiance" /></div>

  <p>The theoretical half-width of the instrument line-spread
  functions correspond to spectral resolutions of 1.25 nm at 415
  nm, increasing to 11.25 nm at 1050 nm. One could assume a
  Gaussian response function, S(&lambda;), for each element using
  its full-width half-maximum (FWHM), and sum up all the elements
  of the band. However, in the header of the CHRIS files, although
  the CCD row number for lower and upper wavelengths of each band
  is provided, the FWHM of each CCD element is not. Therefore, for
  the shake of simplicity, the spectral response of a CHRIS band,
  S<sub>i</sub>(&lambda;), is defined as a bell-shaped function
  depending on the mid-wavelength, &lambda;<sub>i</sub>, and the
  band width, &Delta;&lambda;<sub>i</sub>, of the band,
  directly:</p>

  <div align="center"><img src=
  "images/ChrisSpectralBandResponseFormula.jpg" alt=

  <p>where both the mid-wavelength and the band width values for
  each channel are included in the CHRIS file.</p>

  <h4>User Interface</h4>

  <p>The TOA Reflectance Computation tool can be invoked from VISAT
  <b>Tools</b> menu by selecting the <b>TOA Reflectance
  Computation...</b> command in the <b>CHRIS/Proba Tools</b>
  submenu.</p>

  <h5>IO Parameters Tab</h5>

  <p align="center"><img src=
  "images/IOParameterReflComputation.jpg" alt=
  "IO Parameters Tab" /></p>

  <h6>Source Product Group</h6>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Here the user specifies the name of
  the source product. The combo box presents a list of all products
  open in VISAT. The user may select one of these or, by clicking
  on the button next to the combo box, choose a product from the
  file system.</p>

  <h6>Target Product Group</h6>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Used to specify the name of the target
  product.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Save as:</b> Used to specify whether the target
  product should be saved to the file system. The combo box
  presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF,
  and HDF5. The text field allows to specify a target
  directory.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Open in VISAT:</b> Used to specify whether the
  target product should be opened in VISAT. When the the target
  product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.</p>

  <h5>Processing Parameters Tab</h5>

  <p align="center"><img src=
  "images/ProcessingParameterReflComputation.jpg" alt=
  "Processing Parameters Tab" /></p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Copy radiance bands:</b> Here the user selects
  whether the radiance bands shall be copied to the output product
  or not.</p>

  <h5>Dialog Buttons</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Run</b> Creates the target product. The
  processing is actually deferred until the target band data are
  accessed, either by writing the product to the file system or by
  viewing the band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked,
  the processing is triggered automatically.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Close</b> Closes the dialog.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Help</b> Displays this page in VISAT Help.</p>
