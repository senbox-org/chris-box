  <h3>CHRIS/Proba Extract Features</h3>

  <p>The Extract Features Tool is used to extract surface and
  atmospheric features from CHRIS images. Before you can perform
  the <b>Feature Extraction</b> on the CHRIS product, you have to
  apply the <b>TOA Reflectance Computation</b> first.</p>

  <h4>Extract Features Algorithm</h4>

  <p>The measured spectral signature depends on the illumination,
  the atmosphere, and the sur- face. The figure below shows CHRIS
  Mode 1 band locations compared with the spectral curve of healthy
  vegetation, bare soil, and the atmospheric transmittance. The
  spectral bands free from atmo- spheric absorptions contain
  information about the surface reflectance, while others are
  mainly affected by the atmosphere.</p>

  <p>At this step, rather than working with the spectral bands
  only, physically-inspired features are extracted in order to
  increase the separability of clouds and surface covers. These
  features are extracted independently from the bands that are free
  from strong gaseous absorptions, &lambda;<sub>i</sub> &sub;
  B<sub>S</sub>, and from the bands affected by the atmosphere,
  &lambda;<sub>i</sub> &sub; B<sub>A</sub>. A detailed analysis of
  the extracted features can be found in the ATBD.</p>

  <h4>User Interface</h4>

  <p>The Extract Features tool can be invoked from VISAT
  <b>Tools</b> menu by selecting the <b>Extract Features</b>
  command in the <b>CHRIS/Proba Tools</b> submenu.</p>

  <p>Selecting the <b>Extract Features</b> command brings up
  following dialog :</p>

  alt="Extract Features Dialog" /></p>

  <h5>IO Parameters Tab</h5>

  <h6>Source Product Group</h6>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Here the user specifies the source
  product. The combo box presents a list of all products open in
  VISAT. The user may select one of these or, by clicking on the
  button next to the combo box, choose a product from the file
  system.</p>

  <h6>Target Product Group</h6>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Used to specify the name of the target
  product.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Save as:</b> Used to specify whether the target
  product should be saved to the file system. The combo box
  presents a list of file formats, currently BEAM-DIMAP, GeoTIFF,
  and HDF5. The text field allows to specify a target
  directory.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Open in VISAT:</b> Used to specify whether the
  target product should be opened in VISAT. When the the target
  product is not saved, it is opened in VISAT automatically.</p>

  <h5>Dialog Buttons</h5>

  <p class="i1"><b>Run</b> Creates the target product. The
  processing is actually deferred until the target band data are
  accessed, either by writing the product to the file system or by
  viewing the band data. When the <b>Save as</b> option is checked,
  the processing is triggered automatically.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Close</b> Closes the dialog.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Help</b> Displays this page in VISAT Help.</p>
