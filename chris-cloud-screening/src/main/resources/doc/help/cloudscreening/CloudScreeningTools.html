  <h3>CHRIS/Proba Cloud Screening</h3>

  <p>The Cloud Screening Tools is used to mask cloudy pixels in
  CHRIS images. The cloud masking algorithm described below helps
  the user to find cloudy regions in the image and provides cloud
  probability and abundances for each pixel instead of a single
  flag.</p>

  <h4>Cloud Screening Algorithm</h4>

  <p><b>The cloud screening algorithm consists of the following
  steps:</b></p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>TOA Reflectance Computation:</b> <a href=
    "../reflectancecomputation/ReflectanceComputationTool.html">Top-of-Atmosphere
    reflectance</a> is estimated from the CHRIS products to remove
    in practice the dependence on particular illumination
    conditions (day of the year and angular configuration).</li>

    <li><b>Feature extraction:</b> physically-inspired features are
    extracted to increase separability of clouds and surface taking
    into account that the measured spectral signature depends on
    the illumination (TOA reflectance is already estimated), the
    atmosphere (oxygen and water vapor atmospheric absorptions are
    used to estimate the optical path related to the cloud height),
    and the surface (spectral whiteness and brightness helps to
    characterize the cloud's spectral behavior).</li>

    <li><b>Image clustering:</b> an unsupervised <a href=
    "../clusteranalysis/EM.html">Expectation-Maximization</a> (EM)
    <a href="../clusteranalysis/ClusterAnalysis.html">clustering
    algorithm</a> is performed on the extracted features in order
    to separate clouds from the ground-cover while obtaining
    posterior probabilities of each pixel to each cluster.</li>

    <li><b>Cluster labeling:</b> resulting clusters are
    subsequently labeled by the user. Once all clusters
    corresponding to clouds have been identified, it is
    straightforward to merge all the clusters belonging to a cloud
    type (cloud-clusters). In the clustering of the extracted
    features, the EM algorithm provides a probabilistic membership
    for each cluster, thus the probability of being cloud is
    computed as the sum of the posteriors of the
    cloud-clusters.</li>

    <li><b>Spectral unmixing:</b> a Fully Constrained Linear
    Spectral Unmixing (FCLSU) is applied to the image in order to
    obtain the fraction of cloud content for each pixel (rather
    than flags or a binary classification).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The final cloud product is obtained combining the cloud
  probability and the cloud fraction by means of a pixel-by-pixel
  multiplication. That is, combining two complementary sources of
  information processed by independent methods: the cloud
  probability (obtained from the extracted features), which is
  close to one in cloud-like pixels and close to zero in remaining
  areas; and the cloud abundance or mixing (obtained from the
  spectra).</p>

  <h4>User Interface</h4>

  <p>The Cloud Screening tool can be invoked from VISAT
  <b>Tools</b> menu by selecting the <b>Cloud Screening...</b>
  command in the <b>CHRIS/Proba Tools</b> submenu. It performs the
  cloud screening on the currently selected product, if
  applicable.</p>

  <p>Selecting the <b>Cloud Screening...</b> command brings up the
  following dialog :</p>

  <p align="center"><img src=
  "images/CloudScreeningInitialDialog.png" alt=
  "Cluster Analysis Progress Dialog" /></p>

  <h6>Source Product</h6>

  <p class="i1"><b>Name:</b> Here the user specifies the source
  product. The combo box presents a list of all products open in
  VISAT. The user may select one of these or, by clicking on the
  button next to the combo box, choose a product from the file
  system.</p>

  <h6>Processing Parameter</h6>

  <p class="i1"><b>Number of clusters:</b> Use this field to
  specify the number of clusters. The default is 14 clusters.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Number of iterations:</b> Use this field to
  specify the maximum number of iterations to be carried out. The
  default is 30 iterations. The cluster analysis stops when the
  maximum number of iterations is exceeded.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Random seed:</b> Use this field to specify the
  random seed used to initialize the clustering algorithm. The
  default seed is 31415.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Use NIR brightness:</b> Specifies whether or not
  to use the NIR brigthnness for clustering.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Use NIR whiteness:</b> Specifies whether or not
  to use the NIR whiteness for clustering.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Use atmospheric water vapour feature:</b>
  Specifies whether or not to use the atmospheric water vapour
  feature for clustering.</p>

  <p class="i1"><b>Use atmospheric oxygen feature:</b> Specifies
  whether or not to use atmospheric oxygen feature for
  clustering.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/ClusterAnalysisProgress.jpg"
  alt="Cluster Analysis Progress Dialog" /></p>

  <p>While the progress dialog is shown the first three steps (TOA
  Reflectance Computation, Feature extraction, Image clustering) of
  the algorithm are performed. This might take some time. Depending
  on the size of the scene and on the performance of your
  system.</p>

  <p>After the cluster analysis has been performed two scene images
  are opened. One is an RGB image of the scene the other is the
  resulting image of the clustering. Additionally a window is
  opened showing a table with an entry for each class.</p>

  <p class="inote"><b>Hint:</b><br />
  Use the <b>Tile Evenly</b> command in the <b>Window</b> menu to
  display both scenes side by side.<br />
  It's also useful to synchronize both views. Use the chain symbol
  in the <a href=
  "visat/NavigationWindow.html#synchronise">Navigation Window</a>
  for that purpose.</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/CloudLabelingWindows.png" alt=
  "Manual Cloud Labeling" /></p>

  <p><b>Manual Cloud Labeling</b><br />
  Mark the classes as cloud which you can identify to be a cloud
  class.<br />
  If one class contains cloud and surface samples you can reject
  them (mixed clusters are rejected). Thereby the concerned samples
  will be re-distributed to the classes with the second highest
  probability.<br />
  You can also enable the computation of the probabilistic cloud
  mask by means of spectral unmixing. This will give a better
  separation between real cloud pixels and those which were wrongly
  classified as cloud by the clustering.<br />
  After you're satisfied with your labeling settings you can click
  on the <b>Run</b> button. The resulting mask is added to the
  source product as band named <b>cloud_product</b>.</p>

  <p class="inote"><b class="note">Note:</b> The probabilistic
  cloud mask gives you better results in uncertain cases, but note
  that it can be very time consuming.</p>

  <h4>The Cloud Mask Result</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><b>without probabilistic cloud mask</b> results in a binary
    mask, only distinguishing between one and zero. Where one means
    cloud and zero means cloud free.<br /></li>

    <li><b>with probabilistic cloud mask</b> results in a gradient
    mask, whose values vary from zero and one. The higher the value
    the higher is the probability that the sample is a
    cloud.<br /></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>CHRIS Acquisition Modes</h4>

  <p>One of the main advantages of CHRIS instrument is the high
  configurability of its operation mode. In fact, the number of
  bands and their nominal wavelength allocations changes to a great
  extent from one mode to another. However, this advantage is a
  problem for the detection of clouds since the method has to take
  into account the number and configuration of the spectral bands
  for each CHRIS acquisition mode.</p>

  <p>The cloud screening algorithm has been designed for CHRIS
  Modes with full spectral information (Modes 1 and 5). For
  example, the oxygen and water vapor atmospheric absorptions or
  the ice/snow absorption are only present in the spectral region
  registered by Modes 1 and 5. In addition, in the case of the
  brightness and whiteness features, the number of spectral bands
  available to compute them is lower for modes 2, 3, and 4.
  Therefore the robustness and the discrimination power of the
  extracted features will be poorer for these modes. In
  consequence, the proposed algorithm might present a poor
  performance for Modes 2-3-4 images in critical cloud screening
  situations, such as over bright surfaces (ice, snow, sand, etc)
  and around cloud borders or thin semitransparent clouds.</p>

  <p class="inote"><b class="note">Note:</b> In these cases, the
  default options of the <b>Compute Cloud Mask</b> command in the
  <b>CHRIS/Proba Tools</b> submenu could be inappropriate. If
  resulting clusters are not satisfactory, the user should run
  again the steps of the cloud screening algorithm with the
  following options:<br />
  - To select the most appropriate extracted features as source
  bands in the <a href="../clusteranalysis/EM.html">cluster
  analysis</a>.<br />
  - To change the number of clusters in the <a href=
  "../clusteranalysis/EM.html">cluster analysis</a>.</p>
